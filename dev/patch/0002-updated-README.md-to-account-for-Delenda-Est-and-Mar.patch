+The mods [Delenda Est](https://github.com/JustusAvramenko/delenda_est) and [Mare Nostrum](https://github.com/Mare-Nostrum-0AD/mare_nostrum) support this feature natively. Please do not try to run this mod on top of these mods, as the redundant code will cause some problems. Civs from _Delenda Est_ are still supported in case they are integrated into _Empires Ascendant_ or other mods.
