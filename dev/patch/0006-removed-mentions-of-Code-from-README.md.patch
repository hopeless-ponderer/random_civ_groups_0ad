 - Title: The name that will appear in the civ selection menu
 - Tooltip: A brief description of the selection group
-- Code: A short, lowercase code which the program will use to identify the selection group
 - GUIOrder: A number that identifies where the selection group will appear in the selection menu. Lower numbers will appear higher.
 - Weights: The list of civs to be selected from and the probability of selecting each one. Weights can be any number greater than zero. The probability of each civ being selected is determined by its weight as a percentage of the sum of weights. Using "*" will apply a default weight to all civs (subsequently setting a civ's weight to 0 will remove it from the selection).
 - Color (optional): The color of text used in the selection menu. Defaults to the same color as Random.
